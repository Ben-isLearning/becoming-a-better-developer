Agile Mythbusting
    Agile helps teams deliver sooner 
        Agile encourages teams to work in smaller increments 
        Teams may learn that not all features planned are actually required 
        Teams new to agile may see an initial drop in their speed (Temporary)

    Agile and Scrum are not the same thing 
        Scrum is an approach to Agile 
        Scrum implements the ideas in the Agiule manifesto
        
    Agile processes are lightweight 
        Each agile approach is only lightweight in certain facets of its implementation 
        Scrum produces lightweight documentation and artifacts 
        Scrum is comparitively high ceremony

    Establishes a steady cadency for delivery 
    More adapatable to volatile environments
