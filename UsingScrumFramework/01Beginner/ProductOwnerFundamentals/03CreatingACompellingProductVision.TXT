Creating a Compelling Product Vision


Understanding the Elements of a Product Vision 
    Eveyone participates in the Product Vision so everyone understands the product's goals 

    Great product visions communicate
        WHAT the product will do        (And what the problem will be solving) 
        WHO the product is for          (Clearly understand which user's this is for)
        WHY the product will do it      (Team understanding of Motivation behind product)


Recognising the traits of a great product vision 
    "How do we know what a great product vision looks like" 

    -Shared 
        Entire team understands the vision 
    -Succinct
        Stated concicely and quickly understood 
        (If the vision can be communicated within 30s, its probably succinct enough)
    -Emergent 
        Grows and evolves as more is learned about the product
