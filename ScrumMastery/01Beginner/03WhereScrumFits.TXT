Where Scrum Fits

The Five Values of Scrum 
    Focus 
        Limit focus to only a few things at a time, increasing focus on each item. 
        Break a large project over smaller sprints 
        
    Courage
        Result of Scrum's collaborative nature 
        Cross-functional team works closely together, increasing their overall capability 

    Openness
        Ties back to Transparency
        Regular reviews of work, 
        Regular planning exercises 
        Transparent Communication 
        Sharing project plans and metrics with wider organisation 

    Commitment
        Producing the highest quality work possible 
        Always being transparent about true status of each item with stakeholders 
        Commiting to a specific amount of work at beginning of each sprint (could be a forecast, or could be death by overtime)

    Respect 
        Showing respect to peers in daily interactions 
        Transparency cannot exist without respect
