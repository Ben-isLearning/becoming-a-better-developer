Understanding Blazor

    Hello Blazor 
    Blazor uses C# and HTML 

        Blazor WASM ~   Can run on WebAssembly, (WASM) entirely on the client. 
        Blazor Server ~ Can also run on the Server too! 

        No Plugins, all based on web standards 

        Blazor intergrates with Js

        Blazor is an ASP.NET Core Framework, Built on; 
            Kestrel 
            Model binding
            Middleware 
            Razor 
            Dependancy Injection 
            Logging 

        Everything is a component :D 
            Page components, or components 
            UI & logic can be bundled together
