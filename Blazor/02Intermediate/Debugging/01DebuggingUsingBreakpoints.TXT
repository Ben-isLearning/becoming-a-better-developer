Debugging Using Breakpoints

    Breakpoints are used to pause code execution of a program 
        Use Cases; 

        Understand Program Flow 
            Observe a program step by step 

        Inspect variables and program state 
            Gain insight in unexpected values 

        Identify erros or bugs

    Setting a simple breakpoint ~ 
        Just to stop the app while debugging 

        Quite literally, just clicking shoulder to add the red dots.
