Debugging Blazor WASM Apps 
    Slightly more difficult to debug 
    *Everything runs in the browser 


InspectURI 
    Setting inspectUri, links javascript debugging interface with .NET debugging infrastructure 

    inside app > Properties > launchsettings.json 

    Set; 
      "profiles": {
        "SweetBites.WebAssemblyApp": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "dotnetRunMessages": true,
          "launchBrowser": true,
          "inspectUri": "{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}",   <<<<
          "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7161;http://localhost:5073",
          "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
          }
        },
        ...
      }


    Strangely, breakpoints are only hit for me on the 2nd refresh? 


Browser Debugging and Error Troubleshooting 
    When app is running Shift + Alt + D
        Can run into error ~ See snip 

        This occurs because the app can't get a list of debuggable tabs from the application 
        Just copy and paste the command given 
    
        Reattempt Shift + Alt + D 

        Hey Presto, DevTools 


Breaking on OnInitializedAsync
    Breakpoints on OnItializedAsync may not be hit on first load, Recomendation is to add load at start of method
